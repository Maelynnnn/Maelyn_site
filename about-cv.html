      <p>
        I am currently pursuing a degree in <strong>Interactive Media Arts at NYU Shanghai</strong>, with a minor in <strong>Game Design from the NYU Game Center</strong>. My background lies at the intersection of design and technology, focusing particularly on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), game development, and dynamic web environments.
      </p>
      <p>
        My interdisciplinary expertise spans web development, AI product design, industrial design, and immersive media (XR/AR/MR). I have full-cycle project experience that encompasses AI interaction design, user experience research, full-stack development, and data visualization. I have received multiple international design awards and hold a design patent issued by the China National Intellectual Property Administration (CNIPA).
      </p>
      <p>
        I also have extensive teaching experience. At NYU Shanghai, I served as a <strong>Learning Assistant for the Creative Coding Lab</strong>, providing real-time technical support to students. Additionally, I hosted <strong>game design workshops</strong>, where I introduced core principles and guided students in prototyping and modifying their own board games.
